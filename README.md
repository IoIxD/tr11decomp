Project for decompiling Tux Racer 1.1 and allowing it to be ported to other consoles and modern OSes.

# How to contribute

Before contributing it should be noted that **everything in the `decompiled` and `source` folders to not get pushed to the repo.** These are for local work only! To actually contribute to the repo, you must edit files in the `patches` folder according to the instructions in the README in ther.

1. Get Ghidra. The decompiler .sh file assumes that the ghidra files are in `/opt/ghidra`; there is currently no script for Windows users.
2. Extract the contents of the Tux Racer 1.1 iso into the `source` folder.
